## _Abstract_

This research emphasizes on proposing an alternative way of conducting SLAM mapping in which the user would lead the robot car to an unknown area in an indoor environment, in contrast to the common way of driving the robot car with a remote controller. SLAM, navigation and vision-based object following are involved in this research, which is either built from the ground up or implemented from the available libraries and algorithms. The robot car is based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) which is an open-source framework for integrating low-level hardware manipulation and high-level algorithm control. The functionality of SLAM and navigation are optimized based on the principles of the corresponding algorithms. Moreover, vision-based object tracking, one of the popular challenges of the robot were attempted with different methodologies, which effectiveness are analyzed and discussed. Finally, with all the individual features integrated, the research goal could be achieved.
