# Underwater Robot for Environmental Protection

## Project Abstract

Simple Exploring Underwater Robot for Environmental Protection is an **underwater robot** which allows people and especially students to do experiments, researches and explore the marine environment.

Since **water pollution** is now a global issue that it would have serious consequences such as affecting the food chains or harming the ecosystem. However, people who wanted to understand more about their water resources does not have enough technique and tools to do experiments. Hence, we created an underwater robot to **let users explore the marine environment** and thus **advocate the importance of marine protection**.

Our underwater robot provides sets of tools and sensors to **collect water samples and data**. It is able to reach tough and deep places that we can’t normally access. Water quality data can then be collected and visualized for users to analyze and research. Our underwater robot has a variety of sensors to detect various water properties such as temperature, pH and conductivity, and it has several thrusters for travelling around. Our underwater robot can be controlled remotely onshore via a tether. Users can move around the robot while viewing realtime collected data visually on a smartphone. Data can also be exported to spreadsheet files for later researches. There are also **cameras** on the robot to let users monitor the underwater environment in real-time. To make it easier to set up and use, we use smartphones and other techniques to simplify the setup procedure and controlling method while remaining options for customizations. With our underwater robot, we hope that we can introduce an easier way for people to explore the marine environment and thus understand the importance to protect it.
